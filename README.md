JCMoveGuessR is a survival game where the player is a neutral piece on a chessboard.

It parses a PGN-file and after each move the player must not be on a square that is occupied by a piece. Sounds easy? The crux is that the player does not see a board. Therefore, they have to memorize the current position to make a decision which squares are save to move to next.
